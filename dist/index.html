        <h3>How does a caterpillar become a butterfly?</h3>
        <div class="info">
          <p>
            As soon as a caterpillar is done growing and they have reached their
            full weight, they form themselves into a pupa, also known as a
            chrysalis. Within the chrysalis, the old body parts of the
            caterpillar are undergoing a remarkable transformation, called
            metamorphosis, to become the beautiful parts that make up the
            butterfly that will emerge.

        <div class="info">
          <p>
            Dogs do not see in black and white, but they are what we would call
            "color-blind," meaning they have only two color receptors (called
            cones) in their eyes, whereas most humans have three.

        <h3>A What are the five senses that humans possess?</h3>
        <div class="info">
          <p>
            Humans have five basic senses: touch, sight, hearing, smell and
            taste. The sensing organs associated with each sense send
            information to the brain to help us understand and perceive the
            world around us.
